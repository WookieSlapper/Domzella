    <h4>Meeting the Wizard</h4>
    <p><a href="http://spykebytes.me" target="_blank">Spike Higgins</a> is my personal guru. The Gandalf to my Frodo. The Mickey to 
    my Rocky. In other words, he's my first resource. Usually, the way it works is that he throws a stick into some dense weeds, and I 
    have to go find it. If I do, I get candy. Pretty simple. It works.
    </p>

        <h4>Learning the Basics</h4>
        <p>
            The first place I went to learn coding was <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank">Code Academy</a>. I was 
            pointed to this site as a great primer for beginners; it totally was! It didn't take long before I was creating basic web 
            sites and modifying them with CSS, while also getting introduced to the idea of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) while I 
            toyed around with JavaScript, JQuery and PHP.
        </p>
 
        <h4>Some Reading to go Along</h4>
        <p>
            In addition to the Code Academy exercises, I was handed my first programming book, 
            <cite><a href="http://www.cengagebrain.com/shop/isbn/9781423901952" target="_blank">Programming Logic and Design</a></cite>, by  
            Joyce Farrell. This was an excellent primer for all of the basic concepts of modern programming. I'm committed to getting an
            updated edition just to keep on the library shelf, in case someone I know wants to give coding a shot. Truly, a great 
            starting point if you're totally new to the idea of computer programming and data manipulation.
        </p>

        <h4>Taking Some Baby Steps</h4>
        <p>
            After a couple of months, I managed to scrape a few coins together and head out to the local book repository to find a
            few resources of my own. I picked up a copy of 
            <cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10361330-html-and-css" target="_blank">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a></cite>,
             by Jon Duckett. This book was really well-adapted for visual learners like myself. It's sleek and modern, easy to reference,
            and there are lots of visual references to go along with the well-detailed information. I like it, and as a matter of fact,
             I'm using it while I construct this page!
        </p>

        <h4>Getting a Little Ahead</h4>
        <p>
            I knew at some point I'd be looking at databases and trying to make sense of it all. In fact, my first project was a game 
            idea that my friend <a href="spykebutes.me">Spike</a> used to show me some basic concepts about Object-Oriented Programming
            and C#. I figured it would be a great time to pick up a reference guide, so I also snagged a copy of 
            <cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173346.Sams_Teach_Yourself_SQL_in_10_Minutes?from_search=true" target="_blank">Sams Teach Yourself SQL in Ten Minutes</a></cite>.
            (Spike warned me that it was definitely going to take more than ten minutes.) I think it a really solid reference guide, 
            but I have to admit that I have not yet read it cover-to-cover, nor have I mastered the techniques presented within. I assure 
            you, this is not the fault of this book or author, but there ARE only so many hours in the day....
        </p>

        <h4>Moving Along</h4>
        <p>
            I took as much as I could from all these great references and started working on some web sites. This one, obviously, and a 
            web site for a co-worker's small business. It was a great opportunity to practice some skills, pick up some new things, and 
            start getting myself out there as a programmer. By this time, I had been keeping an eye open for interesting and relevant 
            articles and blog posts about programming and the life of programmers and web designers. Again, <a href="http://spykebytes.me" target="_blank">Spike</a> 
            was there with another resource. A web designer named Adrian Hoppel wrote an excellent article titled "Working in the Gift," 
            about working in a <a href="http://adrianhoppel.com/gift-economy/" target="_blank">Gift-Economy</a>. You should check it out, 
            it's really good, and good for the soul. In any event, I decided that my first five design projects would be gifts to  
            people brave enough to trust me to represent them on the interwebs.
        </p>

        <h4>A New Language</h4>
        <p>
            The next step seemed logical: take everything I learned, store it in a back corner of my mind, grab a parachute, and jump 
            into something new. I headed into unknown territory ... well, I should say I was dragged kicking and screaming into new 
            territory. Spike decided it would be a great idea if my next project were to learn C# and ASP.NET MVC. Simultaneously. 
            What can I say? He's an ambitious fellow. So now, it was off to Microsoft Visual Studio for deep, deep . . . deep immersion 
            into the world of MVC and C#. There are a couple of prime sites I was directed to for learning C#: <cite><a href="http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/html/">Introduction to Computer Science in C#</a></cite>, 
            offered as a course at Loyola University Chicago, and graciously provided online; and of course the <cite><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/#fbid=fkk0Owu0DXw">Microsoft Developer Network</a></cite>, 
            which has just about everything I could think of posted somewhere. It's like the Library of Alexandria, without all the 
            fiery flames and such. A great place to try out what I'm learning in C# is a free web site known as <cite><a href="http://dotnetfiddle.net">.NET Fiddle</a></cite>. 
            It's a great place to experiment through trial and error and learning as you go. It's fun, though!
        </p>

        <h4>Not to Mention</h4>
        <p>
            I suppose I should also mention, before I forget, the invaluable resource known as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>. 
            Now, I have to admit, this place can be a little intimidating. It's like being one of the toddler padawan right before
            Anakin Skywalker loses it in the Academy. These guys are scary-good. However, with a little patience and persistence, the 
            answers you seek are never that far away. Keep this site bookmarked.
